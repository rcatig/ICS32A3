# Assignment 3 - Publishing Online

Assignment 3 is an addition to the previous assignments of creating a profile along with added data from the user such as a username, password, bio, and posts. Instead of the profile being written within a file on the user's personal machine, the data is sent to a server to display the profile online. The server allows other users to view each others profiles and posts.
